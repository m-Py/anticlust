Description: Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into
    groups (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the groups are as
    similar as possible. This is accomplished by maximizing instead of
    minimizing a clustering objective function, such as the intra-cluster
    variance (used in k-means clustering) or the sum of pairwise distances
    within clusters. Thus, anticlustering maximizes the within-group
    heterogeneity, whereas cluster analysis maximizes within-group
    homogeneity. For many clustering criteria, maximizing within-group
    heterogeneity simultaneously maximizes between-group similarity.  This
    package implements exact and heuristic anticlustering algorithms as
    described in Papenberg and Klau (2020; <doi:10.1037/met0000301>). The
    exact approach requires that the GNU linear programming kit
    (<https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html>) and the R package
    `Rglpk` (<https://cran.R-project.org/package=Rglpk>) are installed.
    Other functions are available to solve classical clustering problems
    under size constraints (i.e., creating equal-sized clusters), or
    methods for (unrestricted, bipartite, or K-partite) matching. One
    function is available to optimally solve the cluster editing problem,
    which is also known as correlation clustering, clique partitioning
    problem or transitivity clustering.
