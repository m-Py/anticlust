Description: Anticlustering establishes groups of elements (i.e., 
    anticlusters) that are as similar as possible. The package 
    includes exact and heuristic approaches 
    to solve anticlustering. The exact approach requires that a linear 
    programming solver is installed. The package also offers methods 
    to classical clustering problems under size constraints, i.e., 
    creating balanced clusters of equal size.
