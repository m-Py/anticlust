Description: The method of anticlustering partitions a pool of
    elements into groups (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the
    between-group similarity is maximized and -- at the same time -- the
    within-group heterogeneity is maximized. This reverses the logic of
    cluster analysis that strives for high within-group homogeneity and
    low similarity of the different groups. Computationally,
    anticlustering is accomplished by maximizing instead of minimizing a
    clustering objective function, such as the intra-cluster variance
    (used in k-means clustering) or the sum of pairwise distances within
    clusters.  The function anticlustering() implements exact and
    heuristic anticlustering algorithms as described in Papenberg and Klau
    (2020; <doi:10.1037/met0000301>). The exact approach requires that the
    GNU linear programming kit
    (<https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html>) is available and the R
    package 'Rglpk' (<https://cran.R-project.org/package=Rglpk>) is
    installed. Some other functions are available to solve classical
    clustering problems. The function balanced_clustering() applies a
    cluster analysis under size constraints, i.e., creates equal-sized
    clusters. The function matching() can be used for (unrestricted,
    bipartite, or K-partite) matching. The function wce() can be used
    optimally solve the (weighted) cluster editing problem, also known as
    correlation clustering, clique partitioning problem or transitivity
    clustering.
